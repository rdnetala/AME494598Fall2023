Finished writing the code, but when running into the code, my computer cannot handle Arduino well whatsoever. Spent a day in the Media Lounge, but kept running into the following problem in the computer 

Error: Cannot find module MONGODB
Same error popped up with MOngoskin ^^

Couldn't figure out how to fix this on the computer, searched on stackoverflow and reddit for a while

tried to delete and reinstall node and mongo, it still didn't work.

I have to return the tech at 5, so it's going to be tough to finish this 

I set up the TPLink router attached to the Mac, changed the SSID, Password and used the EC2 Setup Address. Did everything that I did for the guide in the previous assignment. 

I'll attach the error messages and the code that I was used.

I'm pretty confident in the code, and I can outline all the steps needed to accomplish the assignment, it's just taking insane amounts of time to make it work on the computer and I have a lot more finals this week.
I definitely should've started earlier, and I hope I can receive at least partial credit on the assignment.

STEPS:

SET UP EC2 Instance

Change code in Arduino to match SSID, Password, and EC2 IP address

Change code to reflect the parameters of the assignment and change the delay

Upload the sketch to the watch and screenshot the update

The final upload I tried to troubleshoot for several hours and coudln't figure it out, which is why I'm writing this.
